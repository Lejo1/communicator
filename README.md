# Secure Communicator

## General
This Communicator allows you to communicate with other players via mod_channel.  
Your messages will be encrypted using a password!

Also supports transferring via chat but that's not 100% working and annoying to other player on the server

Use `.p <channel> <msg>` to write to the specific channel.  
Use `.join_channel <name> <password>` to join a channel with the specific password(optional).
